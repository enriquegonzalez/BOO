						<h4 class="textlightgrey allcaps font-bureau spacecloser textlarge">PRELIMINARY INFORMATION</h4>  <p>EVENT REGISTRATION NECESSARY. Void where prohibited. The BOO (“Sweepstakes”) will begin 7pm, October 31st, 2013 and end at 11pm October 31st, 2013  (“Sweepstakes Period”).  All times in the Sweepstakes refer to Central Standard Time (“CT”). Odds of winning depend upon the number of eligible entries received.  Sweepstakes is subject to all applicable federal, state and local laws.</p>

<h4 class="textlightgrey allcaps font-bureau spacecloser textlarge">ELIGIBILITY</h4> <p>Open only to permanent, legal United States (“U.S.”) residents who are physically located in the Chicago counties of Cook, De Kalb, Du Page, Grundy, Kane, Kankakee, Kendall, Lake, La Salle, McHenry, and Will in the state of Illinois; and Jasper, Lake, La Porte, Newton, and Porter in the states of Indiana and Illinois, and who are twenty-one (21) years of age or older as of the start of the Sweepstakes Period.  Proof of age with a valid driver’s license, State ID and/or birth certificate is required.  Officers, directors, and employees of Sweepstakes Entities (as defined below), members of these persons’ immediate families (spouses and/or parents, children, and siblings, and their spouses, regardless of where they reside), and/or persons living in the same households as these persons (whether or not related thereto) are not eligible to enter or win the Sweepstakes.  Sweepstakes Entities, as referenced herein, shall include Chicago History Museum  (collectively, “Sponsors”), and their respective parent, subsidiary, and affiliate companies, their administrative, advertising, and promotion agencies, and any other entity involved in the development, administration, promotion, or implementation of the Sweepstakes.</p>

<h4 class="textlightgrey allcaps font-bureau spacecloser textlarge">TO ENTER</h4> <p>To enter, simply register for BOO and be present at the event during the Sweepstakes Period. Limit one per person entry into Sweepstakes.</p>

<h4 class="textlightgrey allcaps font-bureau spacecloser textlarge">METHOD OF ENTRY</h4> <p>Your registration to attend the event will serve as your entry into the sweepstakes.   A random drawing from all who registered for the event will take place at the end of the sweepstakes period.</p>
<p>In case of a dispute over the identity of an entrant, the authorized account holder of the email address used to enter will be deemed to be the entrant. “Authorized account holder” is defined as the person who is assigned to an email address by an Internet access provider, online service provider or other organization that is responsible for assigning email addresses for the domain associated with the submitted email address. Entry constitutes permission (except where prohibited by law) to use entrant’s name, city, state, likeness, image, and/or voice for purposes of advertising, promotion, and publicity in any and all media now or hereafter known, throughout the world in perpetuity, without additional compensation, notification, permission, or approval.</p>


<h4 class="textlightgrey allcaps font-bureau spacecloser textlarge">WINNER SELECTION AND NOTIFICATION</h4> <p>On October 31st, 2013, one (1) potential winner (“Winner”) will be selected in a random drawing by representatives of Sponsors from all eligible entries (i.e., registrations) received in advance of the Sweepstakes Period. Sponsors will make two (2) attempts to notify potential Winner during the BOO Event between 7pm – 9pm CST, October 31st. If after 2 (two) public attempts to notify potential winner during this time are unsuccessful, the first potential winner will be disqualified and a second drawing will take place at 9pm CST, October 31st when two additional attempts to notify the second potential winner will take place between 9pm – 11pm CST, October 31st, 2013.  If the second attempt is unsuccessful, additional drawings will take place following the event with written notice to subsequent potential winners. Each additional potential winner will have 7 days to respond before being disqualified.  Potential Winner may be required to execute and return an affidavit of eligibility, release of liability, and, except where prohibited, publicity release (collectively, “Sweepstakes Documents”) within seven (7) days of such notification.  Noncompliance within this time period will result in disqualification, and, at Sponsor’s sole discretion an alternate potential Winner may be selected from the remaining eligible entries. If potential Winner cannot be reached, if he/she is found to be ineligible, if he/she cannot or does not comply with these Official Rules, or if his/her prize or prize notification is returned as undeliverable, potential Winner will be disqualified and time permitting, at Sponsor’s sole discretion, an alternate potential Winner may be selected from the remaining eligible entries.</p>

<h4 class="textlightgrey allcaps font-bureau spacecloser textlarge">PRIZE</h4>  <p>There will be one (1) prize awarded (“Prize”). Prize consists of two United Airlines Tickets for use in travel in the continental United States.  Travel must be completed by December 31st, 2014. Prize is subject to certain terms and conditions as specified by issuer. All taxes and other expenses, costs, or fees associated with the acceptance and/or use of Prize are the sole responsibility of Winner.</p>

<p>Estimated Retail Value (“ERV”) of Prize is One Thousand Dollars ($1,000).  Actual Retail Value (“ARV”) of Prize may vary. Any difference between stated ERV and ARV will not be awarded.</p>

<p>All details of Prize will be determined by Sponsors in their sole discretion.  Sponsors reserve the right to substitute a similar Prize (or Prize element) of comparable or greater value. Prize cannot be transferred by Winner or redeemed for cash and is valid only for the items detailed above, with no substitution of Prize by Winner. All lodging will be at the risk of Winner and Guest. If Prize is unclaimed within a reasonable time after notification from Sponsors, as determined by Sponsors in their sole discretion, it will be forfeited, and time permitting, an alternate Winner may be selected from the remaining eligible entries at Sponsors’ sole discretion. Sponsors shall have the right, but not the obligation to make any deductions and withholdings that Sponsors deem necessary or desirable under applicable federal, state, and local tax laws, rules, regulations, codes, or ordinances.</p>

<p>If Winner chooses to travel with no Guest, the remaining elements of Prize shall constitute full satisfaction of Sponsors’ Prize obligation to Winner and no additional compensation will be awarded. Guest, if any, may be required to execute and return releases of liability and, except where prohibited, publicity releases (collectively, “Guest Documents”), which must be returned with the Sweepstakes Documents, or Guest portion of the Prize will be forfeited. If any Guest is a minor, Winner must be such minor’s parent or legal guardian and must execute and return the Guest Documents on such minor’s behalf.</p>

<h4 class="textlightgrey allcaps font-bureau spacecloser textlarge">CONDITIONS</h4> <p>By entering the Sweepstakes, each entrant agrees for entrant and for entrant’s heirs, executors, and administrators (a) to release and hold harmless Sweepstakes Entities and their respective officers, directors, and employees (collectively, “Released Parties”) from any liability, illness, injury, death, loss, litigation, or damage that may occur, directly or indirectly, whether caused by negligence or not, from such entrant’s participation in the Sweepstakes and/or his/her acceptance, possession, use, or misuse of Prize or any portion thereof (including any travel related thereto); (b) to indemnify Released Parties from any and all liability resulting or arising from the Sweepstakes and to hereby acknowledge that Released Parties have neither made nor are in any manner responsible or liable for any warranty, representation, or guarantee, express or implied, in fact or in law, relative to Prize, including express warranties provided exclusively by Prize supplier that are sent along with Prize; (c) if selected as a Winner, to the posting of such entrant’s name on chicagohistory.org and the use by Released Parties of such name, voice, image, and/or likeness for publicity, promotional, and advertising purposes in any and all media now or hereafter known, throughout the world in perpetuity, without additional compensation, notification, permission, or approval, and, upon request, to the giving of consent, in writing, to such use; and (d) to be bound by these Official Rules and to waive any right to claim any ambiguity or error therein or in the Sweepstakes itself, and to be bound by all decisions of the Sponsors, which are binding and final. Failure to comply with these conditions may result in disqualification from the Sweepstakes at Sponsors’ sole discretion.</p>

<h4 class="textlightgrey allcaps font-bureau spacecloser textlarge">ADDITIONAL TERMS</h4> <p>Sponsors reserve the right to permanently disqualify from any promotion any person they believe has intentionally violated these Official Rules.

Released Parties are not responsible for telecommunications, network, electronic, technical, or computer failures of any kind; for inaccurate transcription of entry information; for errors in any promotional or marketing materials or in these Official Rules; for any human or electronic error; or for entries that are stolen, misdirected, garbled, delayed, lost, late, damaged, or returned. Sponsors reserve the right to cancel, modify, or suspend the Sweepstakes or any element thereof (including, without limitation, these Official Rules) without notice in any manner and for any reason (including, without limitation, in the event of any unanticipated occurrence that is not fully addressed in these Official Rules).  In the event of cancellation, modification, or suspension, Sponsors reserve the right to select Winner(s) in a random drawing from among all eligible, non-suspect entries received prior to the time of the event warranting such cancellation, modification, or suspension.  Notice of such cancellation, modification, or suspension will be posted at chicagohistory.org website may prohibit any entrant or potential entrant from participating in the Sweepstakes, if such entrant or potential entrant shows a disregard for these Official Rules; acts with an intent to annoy, abuse, threaten, or harass any other entrant, Sponsors, or Sponsors’ agents or representatives; or behaves in any other disruptive manner (as determined by Sponsors in their sole discretion).  Sponsors reserve the right to modify these Official Rules for clarification purposes without materially affecting the terms and conditions of this Sweepstakes.</p>
